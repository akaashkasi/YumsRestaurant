# Yum's Restaurant Website

This project is the codebase for Yum's Restaurant, a website dedicated to showcasing the authentic Chinese cuisine offered by the restaurant. It features a home page with a hero section, a menu preview, a detailed 'About Us' page, contact information, and the ability to subscribe to a newsletter.

We will be recreating this website: https://www.yumscolliervilletn.com/ to reduce production costs.
